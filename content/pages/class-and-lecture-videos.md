Students are asked to view the relevant lecture videos, recorded in Fall 2010, prior to attending each class. The lecture videos and class videos correspond numerically (e.g., Lecture 1 before Class 1, Lecture 2 before Class 2, and so on). The lecture and class session videos are also available an integrated format (synced notes, slides, and video) on [Prof. Demaine's website for this course](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall12/lectures/).
