  "course_description": "This course focuses on the algorithms for analyzing and designing geometric foldings. Topics include reconfiguration of foldable structures, linkages made from one-dimensional rods connected by hinges, folding two-dimensional paper (origami), and unfolding and folding three-dimensional polyhedra. Applications to architecture, robotics, manufacturing, and biology are also covered in this course.\n\nAcknowledgments\n---------------\n\nThanks to videographers Martin Demaine and Jayson Lynch.\n",
